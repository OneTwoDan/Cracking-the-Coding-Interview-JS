# Cracking the Coding Interview - JavaScript

This repository contains solutions in JavaScript for the problems presented in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. Each problem is organized by chapter and exercise, with their respective solutions and unit tests.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the root of the repository.
2. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

`npm install`

3. Once the installation is complete, run the following command to execute the tests with Jest:

`npx jest`

This will run all the unit tests in the repository and provide you feedback on whether they passed or failed.

### Running Tests for a Specific Exercise

`npx jest test_file_name.test.js`

Replace test_file_name.test.js with the name of the specific test file for the exercise you want to test.
